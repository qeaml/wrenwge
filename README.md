# WreNwge

An experiment for writing Nwge applications using the [Wren] scripting language.

## Quickstart

WreNwge consists of just one executable, `wn`. All of your game's code will be
contained in a regular Nwge bundle, created with the provided `nwgebndl`
executable. The `wn` executable needs just 1 command-line argument: the name of
your game's bundle **without** the `.bndl` extension. For example, if your game
is contained in `SuperEpicRPG.bndl`, then you'll run it with `wn SuperEpicRPG`.

Feel free to have a look at the [test app](test) to see WreNwge in action.
